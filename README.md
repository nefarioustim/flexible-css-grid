Flexible CSS Grid
=================

This is a quick and dirty demonstration of a flexible CSS grid that uses
negative margins to position content elements around the main content. This
means you can apply a sensible source order where the main content is first and
satellite columns or modules are beneath.

It also allows you to fix the width of your satellite columns without having to
calculate your central column width.
